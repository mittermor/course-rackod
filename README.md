Rackod is a project from @mittermor and @cienbiswas for school purposes.

## Application

The application of Rackod provides classes to organise and plan their important school dates.
Each member of the class has an account and can upload entries that all other members can see.
Thus, only one person per homework/revision/exam has to post it.
